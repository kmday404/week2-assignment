# week2-assignment-image-gallery

Week 2 assignment - we are building the basics of an image gallery.

# Reflection

## Required

- What requirements did you achieve?

1. I managed to add a media query to move the thumbnails to the bottom of the screen but I couldn't get my background mage to cover the full screen regardless what size it was on so I couldn't then add any adjustments to it to ensure it fit both larger and smaller screens.

2. I added alt text to my images but I didnt't have a chance to review any further considerations, I would have liked to include some aria labels.

3. I managed to add buttons and place them where I wanted but I couldn't make these interactive.

- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
  It could be considered that I failed all the goals but I managed to start them all.
- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
  I think similar to my week 1 assignment, I struggle with placing things where I want them. Also.. the button and callback functions. It took me a long while to get my images to appear on the browser... if you click a thumbnail a larger image does appear but I am unsure how to make a larger image start on the screen.
