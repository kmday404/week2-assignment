# week2-assignment-image-gallery

Week 2 assignment - we are building the basics of an image gallery.

# Reflection

## Required

- What requirements did you achieve?

1. I struggled to get my image to cover the full screen regardless what size the screen was... turns out I was applying my CSS to the container but not the image within it. It should adjust with the screen size being used.

2. I added alt text to my images but I didnt't have a chance to review any further considerations, I would have liked to include some aria labels.

3. I managed to add buttons and place them where I wanted but I couldn't make these interactive.

- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
  It could be considered that I failed the second and third goals but I managed to start them all.
- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
  I think similar to my week 1 assignment, I struggle with placing things where I want them. Also.. the button and callback functions. It took me a long while to get my images to appear on the browser... if you click a thumbnail a larger image does appear but I am unsure how to make a larger image start on the screen (not start with a blank background).

## Optional

Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

- What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
  Again, my peers. I used chatGPT this time to explain my own code back to me, this was extremely helpful. W3 schools for the fav icon code (please help me with understanding this)
- What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
  so many, but I think my commit's tell a story... in the end I ran out of time and couldn't complete the task to the level I had initally hoped.
- What went really well and what could have gone better?
